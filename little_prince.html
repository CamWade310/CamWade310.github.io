    <h1>Little Prince</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
             As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.


            <h>
                I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.

            </h>

            <light>
                It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on earth
            </light>

            In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead,
            his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:


            <r>
                "What I see here is nothing but a shell . What is most important is invisible
                ..."
            </r>

            As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself,
            again:

            <r>
                What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a
                flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep...
            </r>

            And I felt him to be more fragile still.

            <h>
                I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff
                of wind...
            </h>
